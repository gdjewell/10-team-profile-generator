# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This application generates team members using Inquirer, FS to write the file, and Jest for testing. It will ask a series of question asking you to first enter your manager's name. It will then take you to a screen to ask you to add new employees (engineers, or interns) to the employee list. Once you've entered all of the team members it will generate an HTML file for you with each of the team member's information depending on what type of team member they are. The application utilizes constructor classes to organize the different classes that are necessary.

I've created a demo video to go over how the application works. You can view it here:
